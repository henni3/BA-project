Supervisor: Associate Professor, Cosmin Eugen Oance
Students: Henriette Naledi Winther Hansen, Jóhann Utne

# Structure of Github Repository
• The report.pdf contains the decribtions of the project, how to convert the sequential to parallel, teori behind a GPU, a testing section and a conclussion based on the tests.
• The CUDA directory contains the CUDA implementation of the 2-Opt algorithm, together with publicly available code from O’Neil et.al (https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~mb92/papers/pdpta11b.pdf). It also contains the performance data from the performance tests on our version.
• The Data directory, contains all the data sets acquired from the TSBLIB95 library (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp/)
• The Futhark directory contains the Futhark implementation of the 2-Opt algorithm
• The Seqventielt directory, contains the sequential implementations of the 2-Opt, ACO, and SA algorithms
